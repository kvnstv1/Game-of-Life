I set out on this project to learn how to plan out an entire project and build from scratch. While the name is Conway's game of life, I intend to learn through all sorts of experiments. 


1. GameOfLife.java : This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
   
2. Canvas.java: You can draw on an empty canvas. I want to expand this to inclide an eraser.
